        an MBA program, professional English courses, and executive programs.
         A.D.U. has received enthusiastic support from the President of Niger,
        the US Ambassador, the French Embassy, the Minister of Higher Education,
        the Minister of Entrepreneurship, the Director of the Chamber of Commerce,
        and the CEOs of the country’s major corporations. A.D.U. is now forging 
        partnerships with international universities with the help of an extrordinary 
        Academic Advisory Board.

        As a result of the profound need in the country and the early success, A.D.U.
        has embarked upon an ambitious growth plan. There is absolutely no doubt surrounding
        the demand and ability to fill all available seats with highly qualified applicants.

    A message from the Kader Kaneye and Meredith Segal, co-Founders of A.D.U.:<br>

    <i>“Why in the world would you choose Niger as a place to found a university? Wait,
     where is Niger again?” Conversations often start like this.</i><br>
    
    We met at MPA classmates at the Harvard Kennedy School as member of the Class of 2017.
    At Peet’s Coffee, Kad first told the story of Niger. Its challenges as the second poorest
    country in the world. Its beautiful people. All the work to be done in terms of economics, 
    politics, youth, women. Its potential. It became clear that the lack of human capital, a
    result of the lack of quality education opportunities, is the common root of all these problems.<br>
    
    Through a stroke of serendipity, we both enrolled in the Design Thinking course at the
    Harvard Innovation Lab taught by the lab’s Faculty Chair, Professor Srikant Datar.
